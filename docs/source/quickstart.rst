## When to use PEP-it?

The general purpose of the toolbox is to help the researchers producing worst-case guarantees for their favorite first-order methods. A gentle introduction to the toolbox is provided in [1].

The toolbox implements the performance estimation approach, pioneered by Drori and Teboulle [2]. The PEP-it implementation is in line with the framework as exposed in [3,4] and follow-up works (for which proper references are provided in the example files). A gentle introduction to performance estimation problems is provided in this [blog post](https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/).
