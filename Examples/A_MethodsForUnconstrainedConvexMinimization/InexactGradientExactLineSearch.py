    Consider the convex minimization problem
        f_* = min_x f(x),
    where f is L-smooth and mu-strongly convex.
    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for an inexact gradient method with exact linesearch (ELS).
    That is, it computes the smallest possible tau(n,L,mu) such that the guarantee
        f(x_n) - f_* <= tau(n,L,mu,epsilon) * ( f(x_0) - f_* )
    is valid, where x_n is the output of the gradient descent with an inexact descent direction and an exact linesearch,
    and where x_* is the minimizer of f. The inexact descent direction is assumed to satisfy a relative inaccuracy
    described by (with 0 <= epsilon <= 1 )
        || f'(x_i) - d || <= epsilon * || f'(x_i) ||,
    where f'(x_i) is the true gradient, and d is the approximate descent direction that is used.

    In short, for given values of n and L, tau(n,L) is be computed as the worst-case value of f(x_n)-f_* when
    f(x_0) - f_* == 1.

    The detailed approach (based on convex relaxations) is available in
    [1] De Klerk, Etienne, FranÃ§ois Glineur, and Adrien B. Taylor.
    "On the worst-case complexity of the gradient method with exact line search for smooth strongly convex functions."
    Optimization Letters (2017).

    The tight guarantee obtained in [1] is tau(n,L,mu,epsilon) = ((L_eps-mu_eps)/(L_eps+mu_eps))**(2*n),
    with L_eps = (1+epsilon) * L and mu_eps = (1-epsilon) * mu

    :param L: (float) the smoothness parameter.
    :param mu: (float) the strong convexity parameter.
    :param epsilon: (float) level of inaccuracy
    :param n: (int) number of iterations.
