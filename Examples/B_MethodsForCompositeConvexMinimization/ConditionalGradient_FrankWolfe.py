    In this example, we use a conditional gradient method for
    solving the constrained smooth convex minimization problem
        min_x { F(x) = f_1(x) + f_2(x) }
    for notational convenience we denote xs=argmin_x F(x);
    where f_1(x) is L-smooth and convex and where f_2(x) is
    a convex indicator function of diameter at most D.

    We show how to compute the worst-case value of F(xN)-F(xs) when xN is
    obtained by doing N steps of the method starting with a feasible point

    The theoretical guarantee is presented in the following reference.
