    Consider the convex minimization problem
        f_* = min_x f(x),
    where f is L-smooth and mu-strongly convex.
    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for the gradient method with exact linesearch (ELS). That is, it computes
    the smallest possible tau(n,L,mu) such that the guarantee
        f(x_n) - f_* <= tau(n,L,mu) * ( f(x_0) - f_* )
    is valid, where x_n is the output of the gradient descent with exact linesearch, and where x_* is the minimizer of f.

    In short, for given values of n and L, tau(n,L) is be computed as the worst-case value of f(x_n)-f_* when
    f(x_0) - f_* == 1.

    The detailed approach (based on convex relaxations) is available in
    [1] De Klerk, Etienne, FranÃ§ois Glineur, and Adrien B. Taylor.
    "On the worst-case complexity of the gradient method with exact line search for smooth strongly convex functions."
    Optimization Letters (2017).

    The tight guarantee obtained in [1] is tau(n,L,mu) = ((L-mu)/(L+mu))**(2*n).

    :param L: (float) the smoothness parameter.
    :param mu: (float) the strong convexity parameter.
    :param n: (int) number of iterations.
