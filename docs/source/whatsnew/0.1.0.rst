What's new in PEPit 0.1.0
=========================

- The method ``add_constraint`` has been added to the class ``PEP`` for general constraints not necessarily related to a specific function.
For readability of your code,
we suggest to use the method ``set_initial_condition`` when the constraint is the initial one,
and the method ``add_constraint`` for any other constraint.

- CVXPY solver options can be provided to the method ``PEP.solve``.

- The `tracetrick` option of the method ``PEP.solve`` has been replaced by `dimension_reduction_heuristic`.
Set to None by default, this option can be set to "trace" or "logdet{followed by a number}" to use one of those heuristic.

- The verbose mode of the method ``PEP.solve`` and of the provided examples files are now integers, allowing a bigger granularity.

- The parameters that characterize a function class must be provided directly as arguments of this function class, not through the dict "param" anymore.
Example: `PEP.declare_function(function_class=SmoothStronglyConvexFunction, mu=.1, L=1.)`

- ``null_point`` and ``null_expression`` have been added to the module ``PEPit`` to facilitate the access to a ``Point`` or an ``Expression`` initialized to 0.

- 3 new function classes have been added:
    - ``ConvexSupportFunction`` for convex support functions (see [1])
    - ``ConvexQGFunction``, for convex and quadratically upper bounded functions (see [2])
    - ``RsiEbFunction``, for functions verifying lower restricted secant inequality and upper error bound (see [3])
