    Consider the minimization problem
        f_* = min_x f(x),
    where f is L-smooth and mu-strongly convex.
    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for the gradient method with exact linesearch (ELS). That is, it computes
    the smallest possible tau(n, L, mu) such that the guarantee
        f(x_n) - f_* <= tau(n, L, mu) * (f(x_0) - f_*)
    is valid, where x_n is the output of the gradient descent with exact linesearch,
    and where x_* is the minimizer of f.

    In short, for given values of n and L and mu, tau(n, L, mu) is computed as the worst-case value of f(x_n)-f_* when
    f(x_0) - f_* <= 1.

    The detailed approach (based on convex relaxations) is available in
    [1] De Klerk, Etienne, FranÃ§ois Glineur, and Adrien B. Taylor.
    "On the worst-case complexity of the gradient method with exact line search for smooth strongly convex functions."
    Optimization Letters (2017).

    The tight guarantee obtained in [1, Theorem 1.2] is tau(n, L, mu) = ((L-mu)/(L+mu))^(2n).
